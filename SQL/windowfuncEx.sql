--Default VALUEs
With ORDER BY: The default frame includes rows from the partition start through the current row, including all peers of the current row (rows equal to the current row according to the ORDER BY clause). The default is equivalent to this frame specification:

RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
Without ORDER BY: The default frame includes all partition rows (because, without ORDER BY, all partition rows are peers). The default is equivalent to this frame specification:

 
RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
