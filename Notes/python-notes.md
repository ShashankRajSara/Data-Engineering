- Everything in Python is realted to Classes and Objects
- String Interpolation or Formatting
- membership => IN , IS
- DEL => removes the reference of the object


- list => mutable data type, sequential collection of elements
- array vs list => ANy data type
- Keys of the dictionary are immutable

- Reference 
- changes depend on

- Function:
    - Positional Argument
    - Keyword argument
    - When both arguments are together, the key argument should be at the end
    - Default argument


- Lamda Function
    - No name 
    - Only one line statement
    - Automatically returns the value


- Map
    - Iterate over the element
    - apply functionality
    - return output
    - Element wise functionality


- File HANDLING
    - OPEN, READ, WRITE, CLOSE
    - Open('filename',access mode)
    - file I/O file IO handling
    - to Save => close the file

- Access Modifiers
    - Public
    - Private
    - Protected
    - default (Package Protected)

- *Name Manling* => Changing the name of __variable to other name 
    - Ex: __salary to _Trainer__salary

- Abstract Class - Child class should implement the methods which are in parent class



- Question

    - Mututable and immutable data types
    - procedural programming
    - *itertator vs iterable*
    - Namespaces in python
    - namespaces vs identifiers
    - list vs tuple
    - Variable stored in Heap or Stack
    - Find out the use case of the zip and enumerate function in python
    - Convert any number to octal and hexa decimal number
    - Solve the String Question

    - Why objects are stored in heap? Why not stack?
    - first class functions vs High order functions
    - use casees of x, a, w (what they do with files)

    - write programs to read csv, JSON and flat files
    - Use cases of readline and readlines()
    - .py vs .pyc 
    - UTF vs ASCII
    - firstclass vs highorder functions
    - __name__ == '__main__'
    - Difference between Windows and Analytics functions
    - Constructor Chaining
    - setAttribute/getAttribute
    - Difference btw UNION and JOIN


    - Melt
    - Date format 
    - Time Delta
    - date_offset method
